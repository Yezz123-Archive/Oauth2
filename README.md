# Oauth2

PlayGround with JWTs used as OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens to encode all relevant parts of an access token into the access token itself instead of storing them in a database âš™

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- FastAPI
- Docker

### Project setup

```sh
# clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/yezz123/Oauth2

# move to the project folder
$ cd Oauth2
```

### Creating virtual environment

- Install `pipenv` a global python project `pip install pipenv`
- Create a `virtual environment` for this project

```shell
# creating pipenv environment for python 3
$ pipenv --three

# activating the pipenv environment
$ pipenv shell

# if you have multiple python 3 versions installed then
$ pipenv install -d --python 3.8

# install all dependencies (include -d for installing dev dependencies)
$ pipenv install -d
```

### Environment Variables

- `SECRET_KEY`: The secret key used to encode JWTs
- `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`: The number of minutes the access token is valid for
- `DATABASE_URL`: The database url to connect to the database (SQLite)

__Note:__ Don't forget to change the `.env.sample` file to `.env` and add your own values.

### Running the Application

- To run the [Main](main.py) we need to use [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) a lightning-fast ASGI server implementation, using uvloop and httptools.

```sh
# Run the app using uvicorn
$ uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Running the Docker Container

- We have the Dockerfile created in above section. Now, we will use the Dockerfile to create the image of the FastAPI app and then start the FastAPI app container.

```sh
$ docker build
```

- list all the docker images and you can also see the image `oauth2:latest` in the list.

```sh
$ docker images
```

- run the application at port 5000. The various options used are:

> - `-p`: publish the container's port to the host port.
> - `-d`: run the container in the background.
> - `-i`: run the container in interactive mode.
> - `-t`: to allocate pseudo-TTY.
> - `--name`: name of the container

```sh
$ docker container run -p 5000:5000 -dit --name Oauth2 oauth2:latest
```

- Check the status of the docker container

```sh
$ docker container ps
```

## Preconfigured Packages

Includes preconfigured packages to kick start Oauth2 by just setting appropriate configuration.
